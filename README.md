# Rapid-Rush
Time Trial Car Racing PC Game built on Unreal Engine 5.1 in Low Scalability Settings (Due to Hardware Limitations) using Nanite. Built an Open World Environment using assets from Matrix City Sample UE5 Demo, Quixel Bridge and Sketchfab (All assets used in the game including Megascan assets are free to download). Created custom blueprints including checkpoints, Timer and modified Vehicle Sample Project for creating Gameplay, Audio and UI.
